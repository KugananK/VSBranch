modules = other files we can use to extend the functionality of script
module are basically libraries

to access a module:
    use import keyword
    these need to be done before like classes in java
    python has a few built in modules that can be imported
we can import as many as needed
to reference it module_name.object_name

We can easily import objects from other modules that are located in the 
same directory by importing file name and specifying objects we wish to use

mod1, mod2 are both in the smae directory, to import one all we need to done
is specify the filename of the module we wish to import

to import from a folder a level lower than our current file
we import specifying folder_name.module_name
in his example he did mod4.mod4
if they are in different folders such as importing something from day2 to day3

we can use modules from pypi.org
we install them via pip3
which needs to be installed with
sudo apt install python3-pip

to install modules
pip3 install modulename
once installed import as with any other modules

when you have a bunch of things to install
make a requirement.txt and add all the things to download such as flask, selenium etcetc.

the requirements.txt should contain the name of pypi modules you wish to install.
then run command
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

if we haven't been regularly updating requirements.txt we can get all python modules added to a file via 
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
