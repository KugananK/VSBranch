done with pytest
install from pypi
pip3 install pytest
testing should bew down in seperate folder

# def fun(x):
#     return x * 2

# def test_fun():
#     assert fun(4) == 0
#     # this assert statment will allow us to establish what should be outputted
#     #given a certain parameter is passed into the function

When writing tests, they should reside in a file called test_<name>.py

example in exunittesting folder

the empty __init__.py in test and program is what connects the folders

need to install pip3
sudo apt install python3-pip on the vm
# watch the recording to go through testing again
how to run
method 1:

    run python3 -m pytest

method 2: (using pytest cov)
    install pytest -cov
        pip3 install pytest-cov
    cd into directory containing program and test directories
    run python3 -m pytest<file containing test>--cov=<app folder>

to get coverage report to show missing lines:
    python3 -m pytest --cov-report term-missing --cov=<app folder> <test folder>
