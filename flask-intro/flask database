Used to store and access information
    to store large amounts of data
    persistence

done with SQL Alchemy
    needs to be installed via pip3
    Allows us to manipulate DB with pythonic code

Connecting to the DB
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'dbconnectionstring'

DB Connection String:
    Inbuilt: 'sqlite:///data.db'
        ## sqlite is the type of database
        ## data.db is the database name
    
    Stand alone DB:
        "mysql+pymysql://username:password@host/database_name"
            ## mysql+pymysql is the type of DB
            ## username:password is the things used to connect to the DB
            ## @host is the ip of the db instance
            ## database_name is the exact DB on the server(this must be an existing server)
 
 Best practise to hide these dbconnection strings via enviroment variables
 app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = os.getenv("DATABASE_URI")
    os needs to be imported (import OS)

to set enviroment variables:
    in terminal enter:
        export variable = value

example in 2-flask/db
neeed to import flask and sqlalchemy
then create.py which imports the db object
then in create.py delete the schema and create schema.

Should use envirmoent variables as people can get access to your DB if not
